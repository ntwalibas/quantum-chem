# Hydrogen molecule ground state energy

In this experiment, we seek to understand how the choice of Ansatz
influences the ground state energy for our given molecule.

We also seek to understand how entanglement influences the found ground state energy.

Last, we seek to understand how many minimization steps are required for each
choice of Ansatz and the entanglement therein.

## Reference paper

[Quantum optimization using variational algorithms on near-term quantum devices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01022v2.pdf)


## Ansatz used

Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz is used for now while the paper used heuristic trial-states ansatz.
New code using the paper ansatz coming soon!
